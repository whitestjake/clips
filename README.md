# Clipz

This web application was developed using Angular CLI

If you would like to check out the development in your own environment

clone the repository and then you can launch it with ng serve (or npm start)

This video sharing web application is designed by a gamer for gamers to be able
to upload their favorite clips and share them with their friends with ease.

I am on the fence about making this one live as it is only a passion project and the
amount of data video storage requires (not to mention the costs associated) can get
pretty high... none the less, please feel free to clone the repository and check it out.
